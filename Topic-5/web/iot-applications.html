      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Software Engineering Student at Chitkara University. I like to learn new languages and solve problems,
        sometimes the ones I've created for myself. Never afraid to try new things but a bit cautious at the same time.
        I sometimes don't have the best ideas but if you tell me something I'd tell you exactly how to accomplish it or
        ask for more data till I have enough to piece together a working solution, I've had various ups and downs
        throughout mostly in my social life which has made me able to communicate a bit better than before. I'm
        currently aiming for Higher Distinction grade and aiming at conquering my inner demons so that I don't let
        myself self-sabotage every aspect of my life.

          <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">What is an IoT Application?</h3>
          <p>
            A software programme or system designed to interact with physical devices connected to the internet is known
            as
            an Internet of Things (IoT) application. IoT applications collect, process, and analyse data from connected
            devices to provide insights, control, and automation across a wide range of domains, including smart homes,
            wearable devices, healthcare, transportation, and industry. Smart home automation systems, connected health
            devices, and industrial IoT systems for predictive maintenance are some examples of IoT applications.
          </p>
        </li>


        <li>

          <h3>Can you think of some examples?</h3>
          <p>
            Examples would be-:
            <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Smart thermostats, smart lighting systems, smart locks, and security cameras are examples of smart home
              automation systems.</li>
            <li>Wearable health devices: fitness trackers, smart scales, and remote patient monitoring systems.</li>
            <li>Telematics systems for tracking, diagnosing, and improving vehicle performance are included in connected
              vehicles.</li>
            <li>Smart agriculture is the use of Internet of Things-connected sensors, drones, and other technologies to
              monitor crop, soil, and weather conditions in order to maximise yields.</li>
            <li>Smart cities use IoT sensors and networks to manage traffic, energy consumption, waste disposal, and
              public
              safety.</li>
          </ul>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>


      <h2>Activity 2</h2>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>What does Smart mean?</h3>
          <p>The term "smart" refers to the use of technology to automate and optimise building systems such as
            lighting,
            heating/cooling, security, and energy management in the context of a smart building. A smart building's goal
            is to increase efficiency, comfort, and sustainability while lowering costs and resource consumption. A
            smart
            building collects data, controls systems, and makes decisions in real time using a combination of sensors,
            actuators, and networked systems. These systems' data and insights can then be used to optimise building
            performance and make necessary adjustments.
            A smart building, for example, might use sensors to monitor occupancy and adjust lighting and
            heating/cooling
            systems accordingly, or it might use energy management systems to reduce energy consumption during low
            occupancy periods.</p>
        </li>


        <li>

          <h3>Think of some smart building scenarios where this will be beneficial.</h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Energy efficiency: A smart building can reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency by
              utilising
              sensors, automation, and energy management systems. For example, the lighting system can be programmed to
              adjust automatically based on occupancy, and the HVAC system can be set to turn off during periods of low
              occupancy.
            </li>
            <li>Comfort and convenience: By using automation to control lighting, temperature, and ventilation, a smart
              building can provide a more comfortable and convenient environment for occupants. A smart building, for
              example, may automatically adjust the lighting based on the time of day or the presence of occupants.</li>
            <li>Safety and security: Using cameras, access control systems, and other security technologies, a smart
              building can improve safety and security. A smart building, for example, might use cameras and alarms to
              detect and respond to security breaches or fire hazards.</li>
            <li>Maintenance and operations: By providing real-time insights into the performance of building systems and
              devices, a smart building can streamline maintenance and operations. A smart building, for example, could
              use predictive maintenance algorithms to detect potential equipment failures before they happen, reducing
              downtime and maintenance costs.</li>
          </ul>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What are the parts needed for it to work?</h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sensors: Sensors are devices that collect data from their surroundings, such as temperature, humidity,
              occupancy, and light levels. This data can then be used to control and make decisions about building
              systems.</li>
            <li>Actuators: Actuators are mechanical devices that can open and close valves, turn on and off lights, and
              adjust temperature settings. The system controls them based on data collected by sensors.</li>
            <li>Network infrastructure: To ensure seamless communication between sensors, actuators, and the control
              system, a dependable network infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular, is required.</li>
            <li>Control System: The control system is the central component that connects all of the building's systems
              and devices. It gathers data from sensors, analyses it, and decides how to control actuators and other
              building systems.</li>
            <li>User interface: The user interface is the means by which users interact with the control system. This
              can
              include a dashboard, mobile app, or web-based interface. The interface should be user-friendly and
              customizable, allowing users to easily monitor and control building systems.</li>
            <li>Cloud or Server Platform: A cloud or server-based platform can be used to store and analyse data
              generated
              by building systems and devices. This can assist in providing insights and analytics on building
              performance
              and energy usage, as well as allowing remote management and control of building systems.</li>
            <li>Integration with building management systems: Integration with existing building management systems: To
              ensure seamless operation and control, the smart building system should be integrated with existing
              building
              management systems such as HVAC, lighting, and security systems.</li>
          </ul>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Activity 3</h2>
      <hr>

      <h3>Think about the control interface required for a smart building IoT application. What are the high level
        features needed for this interface? Think about who will use the interface. Who are the
        users? What are the parts needed to make this work?</h3>
      <p>
        The control interface for a smart building IoT application needs to be intuitive, user-friendly, and
        customizable.
        The high-level features for this interface can include:
      <ul>
        <li>User management refers to the ability to create user accounts with varying levels of access and permissions.
          This allows building administrators to manage the system and delegate control to various stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Device management refers to the ability to manage and monitor all connected devices in real time, such as
          lighting, heating/cooling, security, and other building systems.</li>
        <li>Dashboards and Visualizations: A dashboard that displays a graphical representation of the building's
          performance, energy consumption, and occupancy status. Graphs and charts can also be used to assist users in
          comprehending and interpreting data.</li>
        <li>Automation and Scheduling: The ability to automate and schedule building systems to turn on/off or adjust
          settings based on predefined conditions such as occupancy or time of day.</li>
        <li>Notifications and Alerts: The ability to receive alerts and notifications in the event of an emergency or a
          system failure.</li>
      </ul>
